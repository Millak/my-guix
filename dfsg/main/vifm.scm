    (description "Vifm is a file manager providing a @code{vi}-like usage
experience.  It has similar keybindings and modes (e.g. normal, command line,
visual).  The interface uses ncurses, thus vifm can be used in text-only
environments.  It supports a wide range of features, some of which are known
from the @code{vi}-editor:
@enumerate
@item utf8 support
@item user mappings (almost like in @code{vi})
@item ranges in command
@item line commands
@item user defined commands (with support for ranges)
@item registers
@item operation undoing/redoing
@item fuse file systems support
@item trash
@item multiple files renaming
@item support of filename modifiers
@item colorschemes support
@item file name color according to file type
@item path specific colorscheme customization
@item bookmarks
@item operation backgrounding
@item customizable file viewers
@item handy @code{less}-like preview mode
@item filtering out and searching for files using regular expressions
@item one or two panes view
@end enumerate
With the package comes a plugin to use vifm as a vim file selector.")
