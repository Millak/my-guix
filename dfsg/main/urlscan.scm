    (description
     "Urlscan is a small program that is designed to integrate with the
@code{mutt} mailreader to allow you to easily launch a Web browser for URLs
contained in email messages.  It parses an email message or file and scans it
for URLs and email addresses.  It then displays the URLs and their context
within the message, and allows you to choose one or more URLs to send to your
Web browser.  Alternatively, it send a list of all URLs to stdout.  It is a
replacement for the @code{urlview} program.")
