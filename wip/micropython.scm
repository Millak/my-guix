    (description "MicroPython is a lean and efficient implementation of the
Python 3 programming language that includes a small subset of the Python
standard library and is optimised to run on microcontrollers and in constrained
environments.  MicroPython is packed full of advanced features such as an
interactive prompt, arbitrary precision integers, closures, list comprehension,
generators, exception handling and more.  Still it is compact enough to fit and
run within just 256k of code space and 16k of RAM.  MicroPython aims to be as
compatible with normal Python as possible to allow you to transfer code with
ease from the desktop to a microcontroller or embedded system.")
