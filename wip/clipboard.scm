    (description "This is a clipboard module we created for the Bodhi Linux's
e17 fork, Moksha.  Despite being developed for Moksha, it should work on any e17
Desktop meeting the requirements below.

Clipboard currently is a simple, basic features clipboard manager.  It maintains
a history of text copied to the clipboard from which you can choose with a bare
minimum of configuration options.  Our main ambition, aside from learning EFL
and enlightenment module programming, was to make it light on system resources
with no additional dependencies, integrate in a natural way with the e17/Moksha
desktops and be a usable alternative to other clipboard managers (Parcellite,
CopyQ, glipper etc.).")
