    (synopsis "Scsh is an Unix shell embedded within Scheme")
    (description "Scsh has a high-level process notation for doing shell-script
like tasks: running programs, establishing pipelines and I/O redirection.  Scsh
embeds this process notation within a full implementation of Scheme, a minimal
and clean dialect of the Lisp programming language.  The process notation is
realized as a set of macro definitions, and is carefully designed to allow full
integration with standard Scheme code.  Scsh isn't Scheme-like; it is Scheme.
.
At the scripting level, scsh also has an Awk design, also implemented as a
macro that can be embedded inside general Scheme code.
.
Scsh additionally provides the low-level access to the operating system
normally associated with C.  The current release provides full access to POSIX,
plus important non-POSIX extensions, such as complete sockets support. \"Full
access to POSIX\" means: fork, exec & wait, sockets, full read, write, open &
close, seek & tell, complete file-system access, including stat,
chmod/chgrp/chown, symlink, FIFO & directory access, tty & pty support, file
locking, pipes, select, file-name pattern-matching, time & date, environment
variables, signal handlers, and more.")
